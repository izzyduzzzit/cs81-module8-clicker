# Izarra Villareal CS 81 JavaScript Module 8 Assignment 8A: Cookie Clicker Tracker

# Cookie Clicker Reflection

## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?
The button click event listener helped me to understand the DOM interaction best as well as understanding div id's. I always wondered how dynamic and interactive apps or webpages worked under the hood, but I needed structure and projects to help me understand and put it all together. I love the fact that any element can essentially be access or manipulated via the DOM and JavaScript. That is really cool to understand!

## How did you choose your milestone messages?
I used some code autocomplete but customized them with emojis and text that felt like something I would actually say.

## What challenge or bug surprised you?
This assignment didn't really suprise me as much as the others as I am starting to feel like I've found a rhythm with the process of the assignments. I had trouble the past two weeks with Git on assignments 4, 5, and 6 and trouble juggling all the new material, but I think it is starting to click for me now. The most challenging bit is coming up with what to say in comments because the VS Code autocomplete feature, or plug-in, isn't always correct or the most informative.

## What personal twist did you add?
I added the personal twist of a milestone at 15 and 75 as well as changing the background color upon each milstone update from 10 to 100.

## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?
I think a real world app that would use this kind of interaction would be a shopping cart. When you click a button to add something to a shopping cart it would update the cart icon on the page to show that something has been added and perhaps even display the number of items in the cart.
